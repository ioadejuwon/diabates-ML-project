# diabates-ML-project

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to predict diabetes in individuals using their past medical records.

This project aims to help medical professional cut through some processes. You just need to enter the past records of the patient and the algorithm predicts based on rhe data entered and the training performed if there is any chance of diabeted.

Some of the predictors used in training the model include BMI, hypertension history, smoking history, etc.

Algorithms used in training this model are KNN, XGBoost and Logistic regression.

I am currently considering removing XGBoost and adding another model since I am evealuting for the best model based on their performance.
